<h1 style="font-size:150%;text-align:center">A Quick Explanation on Outliers and How to Find Them</h1>

Hola everyone, I decided to write my first post about outliers. This is a very common concept when handling data and it can, often times, be problematic to our results. So this is the main reason I will write about it, I hope you enjoy:

<h2 style="text-align:center">What is an outlier?</h2>

Imagine having a group of 10 friends and all of you are the same height (five of you are 5'5" and five of you are 5'7"). For your particular group of friend, the average height would be 5'6" and the distance between each individual person and the average is not higher than 1 inch. For this particular distribution, it seems like there is no height value that behaves differently from the other values.

Now, imagine that you meet someone called _Bob_ on your vacations to <b>Colombia</b> and it turns out that your new friend is from the same city as you. When you come back to your city, you introduce _Bob_ to your friends and all of you realize that he is a really cool guy. Now that you have a new friend, you want to know your group of friend's height distribution again. As you already noticed, _Bob_ is really tall, so you ask him and he tells you that he is 120'. Now that you checked the new distribution, you realized that the average height of your group changed to 14'11" and the highest distance beetwen this averager is 105'.
