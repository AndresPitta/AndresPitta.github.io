<h1 style="font-size:200%;text-align:center">A Quick Explanation on Outliers and Why You Should Care About Them</h1>

Hola everyone, I decided to write my first post about outliers. This is a very common concept when handling data and it can, often times, be problematic to our results. On this post I am going to explain what an outlier is and how they can affect your results. So, I hope you enjoy:

<h2 style="text-align:center">What is an outlier?</h2>

Imagine having a group of 10 friends and all of you are the almost the same height (five of you are 5'5" and five of you are 5'7"). For your particular group of friend, the average height would be 5'6" and the distance between each individual person and the average is not higher than 1 inch. For this particular distribution, it seems like there is no height value that behaves differently from the other values.

Now, imagine that you meet someone called _Bob_ on your vacations to <b>Colombia</b> and it turns out that your new friend is from the same city as you are. When you come back to your city, you introduce _Bob_ to your friends and they all like him - he is a really cool guy. Now that you have a new friend, you want to know your group of friend's height distribution again. As you already noticed, _Bob_ is really tall, so you ask him and he tells you that he is 120' (<i><b>Bob doesn't like it when you question his height</b></i>). You then proceed to check your new distribution and you realize that your group's average height changed to 14'11" (Also, the highest distance to the average becomes 105').

<p style="font-size:110%;"><b>Amazing, isn't it?</b></p>

Well, in this particular example _Bob's_ height might be considered to be an <b>outlier</b>. <b>(Concept)</b> According to wikipedia, an [outlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier) is a "data point that differs significantly from other observations". So, given that your and your friend's height is aroung 5'6", having an friend who is 120' seems like an _observation that differs significantly from others_
